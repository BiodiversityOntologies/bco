The Biological Collections Ontology (BCO) is being developed as an application ontology as part of the Biocode Commons project, within the OBO Foundry framework. The goal of the BCO is to support the interoperability of biodiversity data, including data on museum collections, environmental/metagenomic samples, and ecological surveys.

## Scope
The BCO includes consideration of the distinctions between individuals, organisms, voucher specimens, lots, and samples the relations between these entities, and processes governing the creation and use of "samples". Within scope as well are properties including collector, location, time, storage environment, containers, institution, and collection identifiers.
