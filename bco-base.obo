id: BCO:0000003
name: observing process
def: "A process in which a person or machine sees or detects a material entity and selects it as worthy of observation, and which has as output an information content entity about the selected material entity." []
comment: An observing process is distinguished from a specimen collecting process in by having an information content entity as an output rather than a specimen. The information artifact may be written or recorded or just be stored in someone's head (specifically depenedent upon that person). In the context of a taxonomic inventory, an observing process may be called a sighting, which is an ad hoc reporting of, typically, a single taxon occurrence, usually motivated by rarity, individual interest in the taxon, or atypicality of circumstances.

The list would typically contain multiple entities, but may be as short as a single entity or, if a sampling effort focused on a certain taxon yielded no results, even contain none.

def: "A process in which a person or machine sees or detects a material entity and selects it as worthy of observation, and which has as output an information content entity about the selected material entity." []
comment: The information artifact may written or recorded or just be stored in someone's head (specifically depenedent upon that person). In the context of a taxonomic inventory, an observing process may be called a sighting, and is an ad hoc reporting of, typically, a single taxon occurrence, usually motivated by rarity, individual interest in the taxon, or atypicality of circumstances.

comment: IAO has the term document, which is defined as "A collection of information content entities intended to be understood together as a whole" and has as examples journal article, patent application, laboratory notebook, and book.  IAO also has a term for report, but it is not defined. With this term, we want to describe the physical object that corresponds to some information content entity, together with the information content contained in the document or report. This class may be less important for modeling collection data, but could be important for efforts to get hand written (specifically dependent) reports into an electronic (generically dependent) report, and monitoring that process.

comment: This property was originally created in OBI, but in OBI it was deprecated and replaced by BFO:0000087. However, BFO:0000087 was replaced by 'has role at some time', which is not yet part of a stable release. Once the BFO role has been tested and released, it may replace 'has role' in both BCO and OBI.\n\nThere are currently two versions of 'has role', the old one from BFO (which is used in OBI's definition of specimen) and the RO version.  For consistency with OBI, we have used the BFO relation in BCO, but this should be resolved at a higher level.
